#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/MetaBayesDTA](https://shinyappstore.com/a/MetaBayesDTA)__

MetaBayesDTA is a powerful and user-friendly web application that revolutionizes Bayesian meta-analysis of test accuracy, regardless of the presence of a gold standard. It eliminates the need for specialized statistical programming languages like R by offering accessible methods to a wide range of users, including in academia, guideline writing, policy making, and industry. By considering imperfect reference tests, MetaBayesDTA enables significant changes in test accuracy estimates, potentially influencing conclusions and clinical practices. Its comparative meta-analysis feature empowers clinicians to easily identify superior tests, while supporting subgroup analysis and meta-regression for the bivariate model. MetaBayesDTA is a versatile tool with broad applications in test accuracy assessment, offering a user-friendly interface and advanced functionalities to drive impactful research and decision-making.
